Readme for the STGraph-modified version of JGraph

JGraph is a free open source Java library for buiding and editing graphs.

This package is distributed as an Eclipse project:

	https://www.eclipse.org

and contains JGraph 5.13.0.4 in a slightly modified version,
to adapt it to its specific usage for the STGraph application:

Hence this IS NOT intended to be a fork of the original version,
whose unmodified license is included.
