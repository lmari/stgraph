STGraph - Key sign readme

STGraph operates by reading its configuration data from Spring data files.
This generates an exception permission if STGraph is run as applet
or launched by web start.
To prevent this, the JAR classes must be signed.

To this goal, the JDK 'keytool' has been used as follows.

1. a key pair has been generated by the genkey.sh batch file
   (the contents of the keystore is listed by the listkeys.sh batch file)
   (remove the file stgks before regenerating the keystore)

2. the JAR files have been signed by the signall.sh batch file
