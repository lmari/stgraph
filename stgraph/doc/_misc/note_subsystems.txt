<h2>STGraph - A note on subsystems</h2>
The handling of subsystems is at the same time very critical and very important.
Very important because it allows a more complete object-oriented modeling, with (sub)systems as classes and variables as properties.
Very critical because connection rules among nodes must be suitably defined, implemented and tested.
