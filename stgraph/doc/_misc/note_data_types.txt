<h2>STGraph - A note on data types</h2>
Data are internally processed as a single scalar type: double.
The exposed types are three:
- Number (Double, sometimes Integer)
- Vector (written [x1,x2,...] and interpreted as column vectors)
- Matrix (written [[x1,x2,...],[y1,y2,...],...])
Widgets operate according to these types.

The basic functions that create vectors and matrices are:
- vector(n,expr) : create a vector of n elements of value computed by expr, which can contain the system variable $r, automatically incremented from 0 to n-1
- matrix(m,n,expr) : create a matrix of m,n elements of value computed by expr, which can contain the system variables $r and $c, automatically incremented from 0 to m-1 and from 0 to n-1 respectively
Therefore vector(3,1) == [1,1,1] and vector(4,$r) == [0,1,2,3].

Shortcuts:
[x1,x2,...] create a vector with elements x1,x2,...
[[x1,x2,...],[y1,y2,...],...] create a matrix whose rows have elements [x1,x2,...], [y1,y2,...], ...
[x:y] == vector(x,y,$r)
vec[ind] == get(vec,ind)
mat[row;col] == get(mat,row,col)
vec[ind1:ind2] == slice(vec,ind1,ind2)
vec[:ind] == sliceTo(vec,ind)
vec[ind:] == sliceFrom(vec,ind)
x#y == conc(x,y)

To cast among types:
- if x is N, [x] is V (indeed a one element vector)
- if x is V, [x] is M (and therefore if x is N, [[x]] is M) (indeed a one column matrix)
- if x is M, getRow(x,i) and getColumn(x,j) are V
- if x is M, x[i;j] (equivalent to get(x,i,j)) is N
- if x is V, x[i] (equivalent to get(x,i)) is N

and also:
- toNumber(x), which produces:
--- x if x is N
--- x[0] if x is V
--- x[0;0] if x is M
- toVector(x), which produces:
--- [x] if x is N
--- x if x is V
--- getColumn(0) if x is M
- toMatrix(x), which produces:
--- [[x]] if x is N
--- [x] if x is V
--- x if x is M

To get the type of a variable:
- isNumber(x)
- isVector(x)
- isMatrix(x)

Given these tools, each function returns its natural type (e.g., transpose returns M)
