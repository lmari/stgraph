<h2>STGraph - Hidden features</h2>
As an under development system, STGraph contains some features which are not easily (sometimes directly) accessible via the GUI.
They are mainly still experimental...

- "external widgets": controlled by the field it.liuc.stgraph.widget.STWidgets.isInternal
- expression tree: accessible by clicking on the variable name in the dialogs

- M: print some info on the selected entities
- Ctrl-2: dump the graph image to the "/prova.png" file

- in the expression editor:
--- ctrl-S add spaces around infix operators
--- ctrl-T indents in reference to prefix operators / functions
--- ctrl-R removes all formattings
