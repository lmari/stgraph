<h2>STGraph - A note on batch execution</h2>
The same model can be simulated repeatedly in automatic way, by setting a number greater than 1 for the "steps of batch execution" parameter in the model properties.

The standard behavior for nodes is to reset their value before each repetition. On the other hand, STGraph allows to maintain such values during a batch execution, by means of <i>batch variables</i>.
A batch variable is...

only output nodes can be "batched"?
