Readme for the STGraph-modified version of SurfacePlotter

	https://code.google.com/p/surfaceplotter/

SurfacePlotter is a free open source Java library for visualizing surfaces.

This package is distributed as an Eclipse project:

	http://www.eclipse.org/

and contains SurfacePlotter 2.0.0 in a slightly modified version,
to adapt it to its specific usage for the STGraph application:

Hence this IS NOT intended to be a fork of the original version,
whose unmodified license is included.
