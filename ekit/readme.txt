Readme for the STGraph-modified version of EKit

	http://www.hexidec.com/ekit.php

Ekit is a free open source Java HTML editor applet and application.
The Ekit standalone also allows for HTML to be loaded and saved,
as well as serialized and saved as an RTF.

This package is distributed as an Eclipse project:

	http://www.eclipse.org/

and contains Ekit 1.7 in a slightly modified version,
to adapt it to its specific usage for the STGraph application:

	http://cetic.liuc.it/stgraph

Hence this IS NOT intended to be a fork of the original version,
whose unmodified license is included.
