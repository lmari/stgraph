Readme for the STGraph-modified version of Trident

	https://github.com/kirillcool/trident

This package is distributed as an Eclipse project:

	http://www.eclipse.org/

and contains Trident in a slightly modified version,
to adapt it to its specific usage for the STGraph application:

	http://cetic.liuc.it/stgraph

Hence this IS NOT intended to be a fork of the original version,
whose unmodified license is included.
